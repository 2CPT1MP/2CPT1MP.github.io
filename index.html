            <h2>Youtube Blocker v0.1 Alpha</h2>
            <p>This application allows users to block youtube.com website as well as
               unblock it. This is a console application and does not have a GUI yet.
               Blocking works by launching the program with administrator privileges and hitting
               digit one (1) on a number pad. Unblocking works by launching the program with
               administrator privileges and hitting digit two (2) on a number pad.</p>
            <p class="important">The method that application uses requires changes being made to the hosts file and 
                it&rsquo;s respective system folder. Thus the program needs administrator privileges. Ensure that
                you <strong>run</strong> this application with <strong>administrator&nbsp;privileges</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Option Guesser v2.0 Beta</h2>
            <p>The Option Guesser allows users to fill in a set of random options and save them on their drive.
               Then the application, when requested by the user, will output a random option that was previously submitted.
               The application allows you to delete all entered options at once too.</p>
            <p>The installer of the application is optimized for Microsoft&reg; Windows&trade; Operating Systems that do or do not
               have the Java Virtual Machine installed. So it comes with a bundled JVM already. Just install the application
               and run it normally.</p>
